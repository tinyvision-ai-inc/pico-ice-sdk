"blinky" example
================
This example is built as a CMake project:

```
mkdir -p examples/pico-blinky/build
cd examples/pico-blinky/build
cmake ..
make
```

This should produce a `firmware.uf2` file to flash onto the pico-ice RP2040 chip.

See the [main `README.md`](../../README.md) for how to do this.
