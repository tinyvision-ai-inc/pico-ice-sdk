# rp2_ice_uf2

Provides an example for how to configure the TinyUF2 USB interface.

Once connected to an USB host, it will bring an MSC (storage device) interface, that can be mountd as a regular FAT pendrive.
An `UF2`-formatted bitstream can be copied to it, as generated by the [`uf2tools`](../../../tools/).

After unmounting the drive, the bitstream will be programmed onto the flash chip of the pico-ice board.
