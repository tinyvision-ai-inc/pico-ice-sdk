# TinyUF2

These sources come from the [TinyUF2](https://github.com/adafruit/tinyuf2/) repository from Adafruit.

Due to the pico-ice-sdk project being very specific,
this code would not help in the upstream project a lot,
so it is kept in-tree in the pico-ice-sdk.

Changes were added to turn this firmware into a library.
