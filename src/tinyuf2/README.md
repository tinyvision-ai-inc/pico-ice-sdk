# TinyUF2

These sources come from the [TinyUF2][1] repository from Adafruit.

Due to the pico-ice-sdk project being very specific, this code would
not help in the upstream project a lot, so it is kept in-tree in the
pico-ice-sdk.

Light changes were added to turn this firmware into a library, but the
source is for the large majority unchanged.
